## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/civicsync.git
cd civicsync
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL=your_cloudinary_upload_url_here
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_cloudinary_upload_preset_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App Locally
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 6. Deploying (Render.com)
- Push your code to GitHub.
- Create a new Web Service on [Render.com](https://render.com/).
- Set the build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set the start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000`
- Add all environment variables in the Render dashboard.
- Deploy and get your public URL!

## Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret for JWT signing
- `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_URL`: Cloudinary API endpoint
- `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`: Cloudinary unsigned upload preset
<!-- - `GROQ_API_KEY`: API key for Groq LLM -->

## How It Works
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens in cookies, checked on every protected route.
- **Issue Reporting**: Users submit issues with optional images (uploaded to Cloudinary).
- **Voting**: Each user can vote once per issue; votes are tracked in MongoDB.
- **Analytics**: Charts are generated from MongoDB aggregations.
- **Map**: Issues are geocoded and shown as markers with clustering and sidebar details.
- **Chatbot**: The floating chat button opens an AI assistant that can answer questions, search issues, provide analytics, and accept feedback (which is saved as an issue in the DB).

## Chatbot Usage (Feature to be Added)
- Click the Chat button in the top right to open the chatbot.
- Ask about CivicSync features, how to use the app, or request analytics (e.g., "Show me pending issues", "How many issues are resolved?").
- You can also report bugs or feedback directly to the chatbot.
